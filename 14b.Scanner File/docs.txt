BOXES:
This program has a few important rules associated with it.

First off, the box.dat has to exist from the run directory.
For example, if you ran the program from C:/Users/person1/programs, then
the box.dat would need to be located in that directory (or classpath for all 
you more technical folks).

Second off, the box.dat needs to be in the correct format. The first line is
devoted to how many entries follow it. For example, if you wanted to list 8 box
rules, the initial number on this first line would contain "8", then a newline.

The Following lines should be written in the following format:
Letter to build box out of, then a space, then the width/height of the box
(one number), followed by a newline.

ODDOREVEN:
This has basically the same rules for boxes. Make sure it is in correct format.
